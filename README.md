# ‚úàÔ∏è LOPY - Flight Booking Backend with AI Price Prediction

**LOPY** is a backend system for managing flight bookings, enhanced with AI-powered insights to help users find the best times to book cheaper flights.

This repository contains only the **backend**, developed using **.NET Web API**. It connects with a free API provided by **Amadeus** for flight data, and integrates with an external AI model to offer price predictions.
